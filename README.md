## What is Farmily?
It is an app that allows users acquire farm products directly from farmers and producers.

## Why did we choose this?
We noticed that for most farmers and producers, it is complicated to advertise and sell their products. Additionally, for consumers it is more expensive to purchase goods from stores than directly from a producer.
The choice came across as a solution for these problems. This project will facilitate the commercialization of farm products without any intermediaries.

## Features
- User Management â€“ Register, login, as farmers  or customers
- Inventory and  Sales Tracking â€“ Manage stock, record expenses, and track sales.
- Product Listings  and Orders â€“ Farmers list products, customers place orders.
- Product Listings  Filters -Customers can view only the deliverable products.
- Delivery Information â€“ Customers choose the delivery information. Farmers add where their products can be delivered.
- Payment System - Manage payments
- Notifications â€“ Get alerts for orders, discounts. ðŸšœðŸ“¦

## Development
This is an android app developed in android studio using Java, Firebase NoSql, SquareUp Picasso.

### Android Studio Version

## The App
The home screen allows any user to explore the available products even without having an account. From our perspective, this would encourage people to sing up based on the products they see.
