## What is Farmily?
It is an app that allows users acquire farm products directly from farmers and producers.

## Why did we choose this?
We noticed that for most farmers and producers, it is complicated to advertise and sell their products. Additionally, for consumers it is more expensive to purchase goods from stores than directly from a producer.
The choice came across as a solution for these problems. This project will facilitate the commercialization of farm products without any intermediaries.

## Features

- Inventory and  Sales Tracking â€“ Manage stock, record expenses, and track sales.

## Development
This is an android app developed in android studio using Java, Firebase NoSql, SquareUp Picasso.

### Android Studio Version
Android Studio Ladybug Feature Drop | 2024.2.2 Patch 2

## The App
The home screen allows any user to explore the available products even without having an account. This would encourage people to sing up based on the products they see.

The User management pages are connected to a realtime Database on Firebase. This is a NoSql database that we use not only for the users but also for the listings and all records.

The images are being stored on Github for testing purpose but any cloud service could be implemented.
